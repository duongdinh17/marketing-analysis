Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

This project examines a multi-channel marketing campaign through a data-driven lens, leveraging Python in Jupyter Notebook to uncover actionable insights. Using user-level interaction data, I explored conversion trends, retention behavior, A/B test performance, and the role of language and demographic alignment in campaign outcomes.

From exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to statistical testing, the analysis surfaces patterns that speak directly to personalization, channel strategy, and localization effectiveness.

✅ **Key Takeaways:**

Personalized email campaigns achieved a conversion rate of 39.08%, significantly outperforming the control group by ~11 percentage points, with statistical significance (p-value: 0.0064).

Users shown content in their preferred language—especially German and Arabic—converted at dramatically higher rates (up to 71.62%), compared to English.

User reach peaked sharply on Monday, Jan 15, driven by the Email channel. Other weekdays showed stable performance, while Sundays underdelivered.

House Ads performed best across all age groups, while social platforms like Facebook and Instagram attracted younger users.

Overall retention rate stood at 67.57%, suggesting solid post-conversion value and opportunity for remarketing strategies.
